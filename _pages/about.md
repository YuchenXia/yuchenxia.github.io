# Yuchen Xia  
*Doctoral Candidate*  
Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering,  
University of Stuttgart, Germany  

Hello! I am **Yuchen Xia**, a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Industrial Automation and Software Engineering (IAS) within the University of Stuttgart. My work lies at the intersection of **large-language models**, **digital-twin technology**, and **industrial automation**. 

I am driven by an entrepreneurial spirit: the goal is research that creates **economic and social value** for next-generation manufacturing.

Feel free to reach out via e-mail at **yuchen.xia@ias.uni-stuttgart.de**.
